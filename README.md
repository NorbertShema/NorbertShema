## 🚀 About Me  
👋 Hi, I'm Norbert Shema, an aspiring Software Engineer and soon-to-be Husson University alumnus in Software Engineering (May 2026) 🎓, with a B.A. in Management from Southern New Hampshire University. Based in Charlotte, NC 📍, I’m seeking full-time opportunities in Software or Data Engineering. 

I love cooking 🍳 (working on a recipe book) and going on car road trips 🚗💨.


💡 My mission: Build tools that make life easier, smarter, and more connected.
